# CodeAlpha_unemployment_analysi_with_python

This project presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of unemployment rates in India using real-world datasets. The analysis covers trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, with region-wise and area-wise insights that can inform economic and social policies.

## Dataset

Two datasets were used:
- **Unemployment in India.csv**
- **Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv**

These datasets include information on:
- Unemployment rate (%)
- Estimated number of employed individuals
- Labour participation rate
- Geographic region and area (Urban/Rural)
- Timestamps (monthly)

##  Objectives

- Clean and combine unemployment data
- Explore national and region-wise unemployment trends
- Investigate the impact of COVID-19
- Identify seasonal trends and urban/rural differences
- Visualize insights for policy-making

##  Key Visualizations

- Line plots of national unemployment over time
- COVID-19 impact bar chart by region
- Monthly seasonality boxplot
- Correlation heatmap
- Urban vs Rural trend line
- Region-wise distribution and heatmaps

##  Insights

- COVID-19 caused a sharp spike in unemployment, particularly in early 2020.
- Some states and regions were more affected than others.
- Seasonal variations suggest agricultural or festival-linked employment patterns.
- Urban areas faced higher short-term unemployment surges compared to rural regions.
